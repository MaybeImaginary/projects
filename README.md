# Xulab projects at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy Computational Department
Code and data for projects developped at Xu Lab

The research related to the code and data can be found at http://cs.cmu.edu/~mxu1

## Background
Nearly every major process in a cell is orchestrated by the interplay of macromolecular assemblies, which often coordinate their actions as functional modules in biochemical pathways.  To proceed efficiently,  this  interplay  between  different macromolecular  machines  often  requires  a  distinctly nonrandom spatial organization in the cell. With the recent revolutions in Cellular Electron CryoTomography (CECT) imaging technologies, it is now possible to generate 3D reconstructions of cells in hydrated, close to native states at submolecular resolution. 


## Research
We aim to develop computational analysis techniques for processing large amount of CECT data to reconstruct, detect, classfy, recover, and spatially model different cellular components. We utilize state-of-the-art machine learning (including deep learning) techniques for developing CECT specific data analysis and modeling algorithms. Our research automates the structure discovery and will lead to new insights into basic cell biology and medical applications.
